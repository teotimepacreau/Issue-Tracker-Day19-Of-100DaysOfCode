# Project Goals
- textArea length Checker with .length string property
- form values are compiled in an object and then passed to localStorage with setItem and JSON.stringify()
- a recap of the issue is then displayed when form is submitted. It gets and parses the JSON string back into an object. Object values are passed in the recap with template strings.
- then a status updater is possible with a button that updates the JSON
